     Founding
     Tooled leather handbag made by Prada,
     1935-45 (RISD Museum)
     The company started in 1913
     by Mario Prada and his brother 
     Martino as Fratelli Prada, a leather
     goods shop in Milan.[5][6] Initially,
     the shop sold animal goods, imported 
     English steamer trunks, and handbags.
     Mario Prada did not believe women should
     have   a role in business, so he prevented
     female family members from entering his
     company. Ironically, Mario's son had no 
     interest in the business, so it was Mario's 
     daughter Luisa who succeeded Mario and ran 
     Prada for almost twenty years. Luisa's daughter, 
     Miuccia Prada, joined the company in 1970, 
     eventually taking over from Luisa in 1978.
     [citation needed]
      Miuccia began making 
     waterproof backpacks
     out of Pocono, a nylon fabric.
     [5]  She met Patrizio Bertelli in 
     1977, an Italian who had begun his 
     own leather goods business at the 
     age of 24, and he joined the company
     soon after. He advised Miuccia on 
     company business, which she followed.
     It was his advice to discontinue importing 
     English goods and to change the existing 
     luggage.[citation needed]

     A set of numbered Exclusive "artisan 
     fragrances" was first offered by Prada
     at their boutiques and select department 
     stores in 2003. Each scent focused on a 
     single noteâ€”Iris, Orange Flower, Tuberose, 
     Violet, etc. Additions to this line were 
     made again in 2007 and 2010. Prada's first
     mass market fragrance offering, Prada Eau 
     de Parfum, was released in 2004. The Prada
     "Ephemeral Infusion" line, which highlighted 
     some of the notes from the Prada Exclusive 
     line and featured more costly ingredients,
     was introduced in 2007 with Infusion 
     d'Iris.
     Prada fragrances are produced in conjunction
     with Puig
